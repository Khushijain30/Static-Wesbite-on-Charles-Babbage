# Static-Website-on-Charles-Babbage


The project I completed in my Year 1 of university involved creating a static website using HTML and CSS. The aim was to create a website dedicated to an aspect of the history of computing and the internet, which would feature three web pages. Each web page was dedicated to an important individual or technology that played a central role in the development of computers or the internet.
The website included a navigational menu that allowed users to easily move between the pages. Additionally, each web page featured a table with a minimum of two columns and three rows. The table provided a historical overview of the individual or technology, including important details such as year of birth, education, main achievements, and death etc.

One of the key features of the website was the inclusion of a picture of the individual or technology, which linked to a related external page when clicked, such as a Wikipedia page. All pages on the website were subject to CSS styling, which was controlled by an external style sheet.
To ensure the project met the guidelines, the website was written entirely by hand using HTML and CSS. The use of any HTML/CSS code generators was prohibited. The successful completion of this project earned me a score of 100%. The project demonstrated my proficiency in HTML and CSS, as well as my ability to create a visually appealing and functional website.
