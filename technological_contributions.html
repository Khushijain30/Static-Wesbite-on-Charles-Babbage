                        <p> English mathematician and inventor who is credited with having conceived the first automatic digital
                            computer. In 1822, Babbage created the difference engine, which was designed to calculate the values of
                            polynomial functions. It was built to automatically compute a succession of variables. It
                            was feasible to bypass the necessity for multiplication and division by using the finite
                            differences approach.</p>

                    <div class="content">

                            In 1823, Babbage enlisted the help of Joseph Clement to build a prototype difference engine.
                            Clement set high standards for himself, but his machine tools were especially sophisticated.
                            He could charge for their construction and also own them under the customary rules of
                            business at the time. Around 1831, he and Babbage had a falling out over expenditures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Museum of the History of Science in Oxford has several elements of the prototype. The
                            "first difference engine" was born from this prototype. It was left incomplete, and the
                            completed section may be seen at the Science Museum in London. This first difference engine
                            would have had 25,000 pieces, weighed fifteen short tonnes (13,600 kg), and stood 8 feet
                            (2.4 metres) tall.
                        </p>

                        <p>Despite the fact that Babbage was provided with adequate cash for the project, it was never
                            finished. He subsequently (1847–1849) drew comprehensive designs for an improved version
                            called "Difference Engine No. 2," but the British government refused to pay him. In
                            1989–1991, his design was built utilising his designs and 19th-century manufacturing
                            tolerances. The initial computation was done at the Science Museum in London, and the
                            results were 31 digits.</p>


                        <p>The Science Museum finished the printer Babbage envisioned for the difference engine nine
                            years later, in 2000.</p>

                        <h2>Analytical Engine</h2>
                    </header>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>
                            <span class="image right">

                             </span>
                            After his initial effort at building a difference engine failed, Babbage began work on the
                            Analytical Engine, a more complicated machine. He employed C. G. Jarvis, a draughtsman who
                            had previously worked under Clement. The Analytical Engine symbolises the shift from
                            mechanical arithmetic to full-fledged general-purpose computing. Babbage's reputation as a
                            computer pioneer is entirely based on it.
                        </p>

                        <p>The Analytical Engine's key innovation was that it was to be controlled using punched cards:
                            the Engine was to employ loops of Jacquard's punched cards to drive a mechanical calculator
                            that could use the results of previous calculations as input. </p>

                        <p>The machine was also designed to utilise some elements that have since become commonplace in
                            contemporary computers, such as sequential control, branching, and looping. It would have
                            been the first mechanical gadget that was Turing-complete in theory. The Engine was not a
                            single physical machine, but a series of them that Babbage experimented with until his death
                            in 1871. </p>
