                             <span style="font-weight:bold;">Charles Babbage</span> KH FRS was an English polymath who
                            lived from December 26, 1791, to October 18, 1871.Babbage was a mathematician,
                            philosopher, inventor, and mechanical engineer who invented the digital programmable
                            computer.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Some regard Babbage to be the "Father of the Computer." Though Babbage's Analytical Engine,
                            programmed using a principle openly borrowed from the Jacquard loom, is credited with
                            inventing the first mechanical computer, the Difference Engine, that eventually led to more
                            complex electronic designs, all of the essential ideas of modern computers can be found in
                            Babbage's Analytical Engine.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In addition to his work on computers, which he documented in his book Economy of
                            Manufactures and Machinery, Babbage had a wide variety of interests. His diverse work in
                            various subjects has earned him the title of "preeminent" among the century's numerous
                            polymaths.
                        </p>

                        <p>Babbage, who died before several of his innovations, like his Difference Engine and
                            Analytical Engine, were fully realised, remained a key role in the development of computing.
                            The Science Museum in London has several of Babbage's unfinished machinery on exhibit.
                            Babbage's initial concepts were used to build a working difference engine in 1991. The
                            success of the completed engine, which was built to 19th-century specifications,
                            demonstrated that Babbage's machine would have operated.</p>

                        <p>
                            Babbage's birthplace is contested, however he was most likely born in 44 Crosby Row,
                            Walworth Road, London, England, according to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.
                            The incident is commemorated with a blue plaque at the intersection of Larcom Street and
                            Walworth Road.
                        </p>

                        <p>His date of birth was published as 26 December 1792 in his obituary in The Times, but a
                            nephew afterwards wrote to indicate that Babbage was born one year earlier, in 1791. Babbage
                            was baptised on January 6, 1792, according to the parish registry of St. Mary's, Newington,
                            London, which supports a birth year of 1791.</p>

                        <p>Benjamin Babbage and Betsy Plumleigh Teape had four children, including Babbage. In 1801
                            William Praed founded Praed's & Co. of Fleet Street, London, with his father as a banking
                            partner. The Babbage family relocated to East Teignmouth's ancient Rowdens mansion in 1808.
                            Babbage was transferred to a rural school in Alphington, near Exeter, when he was eight
                            years old to recuperate from a life-threatening sickness. He attended King Edward VI Grammar
                            School in Totnes, South Devon, for a period, but his health prompted him to return to
                            private tutors.</p>

                        <p>Babbage then went to the Reverend Stephen Freeman's Holmwood Academy, which had 30 students
                            and was located on Baker Street in Enfield, Middlesex. Babbage's passion of mathematics was
                            sparked by the academy's library. After leaving the school, he continued his studies with
                            two additional private instructors. </p>

                        <p>The first was a pastor near Cambridge, who introduced Babbage to Charles Simeon and his
                            evangelical followers, but the training was insufficient. At the age of 16 or 17, he was
                            sent home to Totnes to study at the Totnes school. The second was an Oxford instructor, who
                            helped Babbage achieve a level of Classics that allowed him to be admitted into Cambridge
                            University.</p>
